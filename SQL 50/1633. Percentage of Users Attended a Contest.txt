LeetCode Problem: 1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

Problem Description:
Table: Users

Column Name	Type
user_id	int
user_name	varchar
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table contains the name and the ID of a user.

Table: Register

Column Name	Type
contest_id	int
user_id	int
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table contains the ID of a user and the contest they registered into.

Task: Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return: The result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Users table:
+---------+-----------+
| user_id | user_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |
+---------+-----------+

Register table:
+------------+---------+
| contest_id | user_id |
+------------+---------+
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |
+------------+---------+
Output:

plaintext
+------------+------------+
| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
Explanation:

All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.

Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%

Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%

Solution:
The following SQL query calculates the percentage of users registered in each contest, rounded to two decimal places:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the percentage of users registered in each contest
SELECT 
    contest_id, 
    ROUND(COUNT(user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Users), 2) AS percentage
FROM 
    Register
GROUP BY 
    contest_id
ORDER BY 
    percentage DESC, contest_id ASC;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT contest_id, ROUND(COUNT(user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT() FROM Users), 2) AS percentage:* This part of the query selects the contest_id and calculates the percentage of users registered in each contest, rounding it to two decimal places.

COUNT(user_id): This counts the number of users registered in each contest.

SELECT COUNT() FROM Users:* This calculates the total number of users.

COUNT(user_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT() FROM Users):* This calculates the percentage of users registered in each contest.

ROUND(..., 2): This rounds the percentage to two decimal places.

FROM Register: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Register table.

GROUP BY contest_id: This groups the result by the contest_id to calculate the percentage for each contest.

ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id ASC: This orders the results by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, it orders by contest_id in ascending order.

Comments:
This solution efficiently calculates the percentage of users registered in each contest.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.
