LeetCode Problem: 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II

Problem Description:
Table: Delivery

Column Name	Type
delivery_id	int
customer_id	int
order_date	date
customer_pref_delivery_date	date
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.

The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

Definitions:

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Task: Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return: The result format is in the following example.

Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |

+----------------------+
| 50.00                |

Explanation:

The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.

The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.

The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.

The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.

Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.

Solution:
The following SQL query calculates the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers
WITH FirstOrders AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
    FROM 
        Delivery
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id
)

SELECT 
    ROUND(SUM(CASE 
                WHEN D.order_date = D.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 
                ELSE 0 
              END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM 
    Delivery D
JOIN 
    FirstOrders FO 
ON 
    D.customer_id = FO.customer_id AND D.order_date = FO.first_order_date;
Explanation of the Code:

WITH FirstOrders AS (SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date FROM Delivery GROUP BY customer_id): This Common Table Expression (CTE) calculates the earliest order date for each customer.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN D.order_date = D.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(), 2) AS immediate_percentage:* This selects the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

SUM(CASE WHEN D.order_date = D.customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END): This counts the number of immediate orders.

COUNT():* This counts the total number of first orders.

ROUND(..., 2): This rounds the percentage to 2 decimal places.

FROM Delivery D JOIN FirstOrders FO ON D.customer_id = FO.customer_id AND D.order_date = FO.first_order_date: This joins the Delivery table with the FirstOrders CTE to get the first orders of each customer.

Comments:
This solution efficiently calculates the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.
