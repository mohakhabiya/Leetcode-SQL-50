LeetCode Problem: 185. Department Top Three Salaries
Problem Description:
Table: Employee

Column Name	Type
id	int
name	varchar
salary	int
departmentId	int
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

departmentId is a foreign key (reference column) of the ID from the Department table.

Each row of this table indicates the ID, name, and salary of an employee. It also contains the ID of their department.

Table: Department

Column Name	Type
id	int
name	varchar
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table indicates the ID of a department and its name.

Task: Write a solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments. A high earner in a department is an employee who has a salary in the top three unique salaries for that department.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| id | name  | salary | departmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+

Department table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | IT    |
| 2  | Sales |
+----+-------+
Output:

plaintext
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

In the IT department:

Max earns the highest unique salary

Both Randy and Joe earn the second-highest unique salary

Will earns the third-highest unique salary

In the Sales department:

Henry earns the highest salary

Sam earns the second-highest salary

There is no third-highest salary as there are only two employees

Solution:
The following SQL query finds the employees who are high earners in each of the departments:

-- SQL Solution to find the employees who are high earners in each of the departments
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT 
        e.id,
        e.name,
        e.salary,
        e.departmentId,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        Employee e
)
SELECT 
    d.name AS Department,
    rs.name AS Employee,
    rs.salary AS Salary
FROM 
    RankedSalaries rs
JOIN 
    Department d ON rs.departmentId = d.id
WHERE 
    rs.rank <= 3;
Explanation of the Code:

WITH RankedSalaries AS (...):

This Common Table Expression (CTE) ranks the salaries of employees within each department.

DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY e.departmentId ORDER BY e.salaryDESC): This part assigns a rank to each employee's salary within their department, ordered by salary in descending order. DENSE_RANK is used to handle ties in salary correctly.

Main Query:

SELECT d.nameAS Department, rs.nameAS Employee, rs.salaryAS Salary: This part of the query selects the department name, employee name, and salary.

FROM RankedSalaries rs JOIN Department d ON rs.departmentId = d.id: This joins the RankedSalaries CTE with the Department table to get the department names.

WHERE rs.rank<= 3: This filters the results to include only the top three unique salaries in each department.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies the employees who are high earners in each department and ensures that the top three unique salaries are considered.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.
