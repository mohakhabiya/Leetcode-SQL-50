LeetCode Problem: 1484. Group Sold Products By The Date
Problem Description:
Table: Activities

Column Name	Type
sell_date	date
product	varchar
There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.

Each row of this table contains the product name and the date it was sold in a market.

Task: Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.

The sold product names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.

Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Activities table:
+------------+------------+
| sell_date  | product    |
+------------+------------+
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone  |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil     |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask       |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt    |
+------------+------------+
Output:

plaintext
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |
+------------+----------+------------------------------+
Explanation:

For 2020-05-30, Sold items were (Headphone, Basketball, T-shirt), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.

For 2020-06-01, Sold items were (Pencil, Bible), we sort them lexicographically and separate them by a comma.

For 2020-06-02, the Sold item is (Mask), we just return it.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds for each date the number of different products sold and their names:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names
SELECT
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM
    Activities
GROUP BY
    sell_date
ORDER BY
    sell_date;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products:

sell_date: This part of the query selects the date on which the products were sold.

COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold: This counts the number of distinct products sold on each date.

GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products: This concatenates the distinct product names sold on each date, sorted lexicographically and separated by a comma.

FROM Activities: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Activities table.

GROUP BY sell_date: This groups the results by sell_date to aggregate the data for each date.

ORDER BY sell_date: This orders the result by sell_date in ascending order.
