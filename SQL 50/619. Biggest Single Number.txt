LeetCode Problem: 619. Biggest Single Number
Problem Description:
Table: MyNumbers

Column Name	Type
num	int
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).

Each row of this table contains an integer.

Task: A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table. Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output:

plaintext
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation:

The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.

Example 2:

Input:

plaintext
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output:

plaintext
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation:

There are no single numbers in the input table, so we return null.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds the largest single number in the MyNumbers table:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the largest single number in the MyNumbers table
SELECT MAX(num) AS num
FROM MyNumbers
GROUP BY num
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT MAX(num) AS num: This part of the query selects the maximum num value from the MyNumbers table and aliases it as num.

FROM MyNumbers: This indicates that the data should be selected from the MyNumbers table.

GROUP BY num: This groups the results by the num column.

HAVING COUNT() = 1:* This condition filters the groups to include only those numbers that appear exactly once (i.e., single numbers).

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and retrieves the largest single number in the MyNumbers table.

If there are no single numbers in the table, the query will return null.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
