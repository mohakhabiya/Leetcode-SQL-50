Patients table:
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 1          | Daniel       | YFEV COUGH   |
| 2          | Alice        |              |
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
| 5          | Alain        | DIAB201      |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Output:

plaintext
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| patient_id | patient_name | conditions   |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
| 3          | Bob          | DIAB100 MYOP |
| 4          | George       | ACNE DIAB100 |
+------------+--------------+--------------+
Explanation:

Bob and George both have a condition that starts with DIAB1.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions of the patients who have Type I Diabetes:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find patients who have Type I Diabetes (conditions start with DIAB1)
SELECT 
    patient_id,
    patient_name,
    conditions
FROM 
    Patients
WHERE 
    conditions LIKE '%DIAB1%'
ORDER BY 
    patient_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT patient_id, patient_name, conditions: This part of the query selects the patient_id, patient_name, and conditions columns from the Patients table.

FROM Patients: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Patients table.

WHERE conditions LIKE '%DIAB1%': This condition filters the records to include only those patients whose conditions column contains a condition that starts with DIAB1.

ORDER BY patient_id: This orders the result by patient_id in ascending order.
