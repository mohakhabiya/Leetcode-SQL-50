LeetCode Problem: 1075. Project Employees I

Problem Description:
Table: Project

Column Name	Type
project_id	int
employee_id	int
(project_id, employee_id) is the primary key of this table.

employee_id is a foreign key to the Employee table.

Each row of this table indicates that the employee with employee_id is working on the project with project_id.

Table: Employee

Column Name	Type
employee_id	int
name	varchar
experience_years	int
employee_id is the primary key of this table.

It's guaranteed that experience_years is not NULL.

Each row of this table contains information about one employee.

Task: Write an SQL query that reports the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Project table:
+-------------+-------------+
| project_id  | employee_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 3           |
| 2           | 1           |
| 2           | 4           |
+-------------+-------------+

Employee table:
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |
+-------------+--------+------------------+
Output:

plaintext
+-------------+---------------+
| project_id  | average_years |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 2.00          |
| 2           | 2.50          |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation:

The average experience years for the first project is (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 2.00.

The average experience years for the second project is (3 + 2) / 2 = 2.50.

Solution:
The following SQL query calculates the average experience years of all the employees for each project, rounded to 2 digits:

sql
-- SQL Solution to report the average experience years of all employees for each project
SELECT 
    P.project_id, 
    ROUND(AVG(E.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM 
    Project P
JOIN 
    Employee E ON P.employee_id = E.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    P.project_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT P.project_id, ROUND(AVG(E.experience_years), 2) AS average_years: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the project_id from the Project table (aliased as P) and the average of experience_years from the Employee table (aliased as E), rounded to 2 decimal places.

FROM Project P: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Project table, aliased as P.

JOIN Employee E ON P.employee_id = E.employee_id: This joins the Project table with the Employee table on the employee_id column.

GROUP BY P.project_id: This groups the result by the project_id to calculate the average experience years for each project.

Comments:
This solution efficiently calculates the average experience years of all employees for each project.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.
