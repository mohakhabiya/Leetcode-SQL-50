LeetCode Problem: 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

Problem Description:
Table: Employee

Column Name	Type
id	int
name	varchar
department	varchar
managerId	int
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the ID of their manager.

If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.

No employee will be the manager of themself.

Task: Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Employee table:
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
| 101 | John  | A          | null      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |
+-----+-------+------------+-----------+
Output:

plaintext
+------+
| name |
+------+
| John |
+------+
Solution:
The following SQL query finds the names of managers who have at least five direct reports:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find managers with at least five direct reports
SELECT E1.name
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.id = E2.managerId
GROUP BY E1.id, E1.name
HAVING COUNT(E2.id) >= 5;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT E1.name: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the name of the manager from the Employee table (aliased as E1).

FROM Employee E1: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Employee table, aliased as E1.

JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.id= E2.managerId: This joins the Employee table (aliased as E2) with the Employee table (aliased as E1) on the managerId column. This allows us to pair each manager with their direct reports.

GROUP BY E1.id, E1.name: This groups the results by the manager's id and name.

HAVING COUNT(E2.id) >= 5: This condition filters the groups to include only those managers who have at least five direct reports.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and retrieves the names of managers with at least five direct reports.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
