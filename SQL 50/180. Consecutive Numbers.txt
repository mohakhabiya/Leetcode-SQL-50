LeetCode Problem: 180. Consecutive Numbers
Problem Description:
Table: Logs

Column Name	Type
id	int
num	varchar
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.

id is an autoincrement column starting from 1.

Task: Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output:

plaintext
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation:

1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.num = l2.num AND l1.id = l2.id - 1
JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.num = l3.num AND l2.id = l3.id - 1
WHERE l1.num = l2.num AND l2.num = l3.num;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT DISTINCT l1.numAS ConsecutiveNums: This part of the query selects distinct num values from the Logs table and aliases the result as ConsecutiveNums.

FROM Logs l1 JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.num= l2.numAND l1.id= l2.id- 1: This joins the Logs table with itself to find consecutive rows where the num values are the same and the id values differ by 1.

JOIN Logs l3 ON l2.num= l3.numAND l2.id= l3.id- 1: This joins the Logs table again with itself to find three consecutive rows where the num values are the same and the id values differ by 1.

WHERE l1.num= l2.numAND l2.num= l3.num: This condition ensures that the num values in all three consecutive rows are the same.

Comments:
This solution efficiently finds all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively in the Logs table.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
