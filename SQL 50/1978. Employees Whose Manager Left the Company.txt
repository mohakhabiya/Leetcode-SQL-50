LeetCode Problem: 1978. Employees Whose Manager Left the Company
Problem Description:
Table: Employees

Column Name	Type
employee_id	int
name	varchar
manager_id	int
salary	int
employee_id is the primary key for this table.

This table contains information about the employees, their salary, and the ID of their manager.

Some employees do not have a manager (manager_id is null).

Task: Find the IDs of the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company. When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the Employees table, but the reports still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

Return: The result table ordered by employee_id.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Employees table:
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| employee_id | name      | manager_id | salary |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
| 3           | Mila      | 9          | 60301  |
| 12          | Antonella | null       | 31000  |
| 13          | Emery     | null       | 67084  |
| 1           | Kalel     | 11         | 21241  |
| 9           | Mikaela   | null       | 50937  |
| 11          | Joziah    | 6          | 28485  |
+-------------+-----------+------------+--------+
Output:

plaintext
+-------------+
| employee_id |
+-------------+
| 11          |
+-------------+
Explanation:

The employees with a salary less than $30000 are 1 (Kalel) and 11 (Joziah).

Kalel's manager is employee 11, who is still in the company (Joziah).

Joziah's manager is employee 6, who left the company because there is no row for employee 6 as it was deleted.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds the IDs of employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company:

-- SQL Solution to find employees whose salary is less than $30000 and whose manager left the company
SELECT 
    employee_id
FROM 
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN 
    Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
WHERE 
    e.salary < 30000 AND m.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY 
    employee_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT employee_id: This part of the query selects the employee_id from the Employees table.

FROM Employees e LEFT JOIN Employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id: This left joins the Employees table with itself to match employees with their managers. The LEFT JOIN ensures that all employees are included, even if their manager left the company.

WHERE e.salary< 30000 AND m.employee_id IS NULL: This condition filters the rows to include only those employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company (i.e., the manager_id exists in the employee's record, but there is no corresponding row in the Employees table for the manager).

ORDER BY employee_id: This orders the result by employee_id.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies the employees whose salary is strictly less than $30000 and whose manager left the company.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
