LeetCode Problem: 2356. Number of Unique Subjects Taught by Each Teacher
Problem Description:
Table: Teacher

Column Name	Type
teacher_id	int
subject_id	int
dept_id	int
(subject_id, dept_id) is the primary key (combinations of columns with unique values) of this table.

Each row in this table indicates that the teacher with teacher_id teaches the subject subject_id in the department dept_id.

Task: Write a solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Teacher table:
+------------+------------+---------+
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
+------------+------------+---------+
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |
+------------+------------+---------+
Output:

plaintext
+------------+-----+
| teacher_id | cnt |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |
+------------+-----+
Explanation:

Teacher 1 teaches subject 2 in departments 3 and 4, and subject 3 in department 3.

Teacher 2 teaches subjects 1, 2, 3, and 4 in department 1.

Solution:
The following SQL query calculates the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university:

sql
-- SQL Solution to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches
SELECT 
    teacher_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM 
    Teacher
GROUP BY 
    teacher_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT teacher_id, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt: This part of the query selects the teacher_id and counts the distinct subject_id values for each teacher. The result is aliased as cnt.

FROM Teacher: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Teacher table.

GROUP BY teacher_id: This groups the results by the teacher_id to calculate the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches.

Comments:
This solution efficiently calculates the number of unique subjects each teacher teaches in the university.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
