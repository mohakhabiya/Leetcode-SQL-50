LeetCode Problem: 1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions

Problem Description:
Table: Visits

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| visit_id    | int     |
| customer_id | int     |
+-------------+---------+
visit_id is the column with unique values for this table.

This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.

Table: Transactions

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| transaction_id | int     |
| visit_id       | int     |
| amount         | int     |
+----------------+---------+
transection_id is the column with unique values for this table.

This table contains information about the transactions made during the visit_id.

Task: Write a solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return: The result table sorted in any order.

Explanation:

Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.

Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.

Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits, they did not make any transactions, and during one visit, they made 3 transactions.

Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.

As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and counts the number of such visits:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the IDs of users who visited without making any transactions
SELECT V.customer_id, COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans
FROM Visits V
LEFT JOIN Transactions T ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id
WHERE T.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY V.customer_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT V.customer_id, COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans: This part of the query selects the customer_id and counts the number of visits without transactions, aliasing the count as count_no_trans.

FROM Visits V: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Visits table, aliased as V.

LEFT JOIN Transactions T ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id: This performs a left join of the Visits table with the Transactions table on the visit_id column.

WHERE T.visit_id IS NULL: This condition filters the rows to include only those visits that do not have a corresponding transaction.

GROUP BY V.customer_id: This groups the result by the customer_id.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and counts the visits without transactions for each customer.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.
