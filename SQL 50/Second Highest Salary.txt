LeetCode Problem: 176. Second Highest Salary
Problem Description:
Table: Employee

Column Name	Type
id	int
salary	int
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

Task: Write a solution to find the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null.

Example:
Example 1:

Input:

plaintext
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:

plaintext
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
Example 2:

Input:

plaintext
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:

plaintext
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
Solution:
The following SQL query finds the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the second highest distinct salary
SELECT 
    (SELECT DISTINCT salary 
     FROM Employee 
     ORDER BY salary DESC 
     LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) AS SecondHighestSalary: This part of the query selects the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table.

DISTINCT salary: This ensures that only unique salaries are considered.

ORDER BY salary DESC: This orders the salaries in descending order.

LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1: This skips the highest salary and selects the second highest salary.

Comments:
This solution efficiently finds the second highest distinct salary from the Employee table.

If there is no second highest salary, the query returns null.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
