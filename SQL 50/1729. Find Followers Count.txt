LeetCode Problem: 1729. Find Followers Count
Problem Description:
Table: Followers

Column Name	Type
user_id	int
follower_id	int
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.

This table contains the IDs of a user and a follower in a social media app where the follower follows the user.

Task: Write a solution that will, for each user, return the number of followers.

Return: The result table ordered by user_id in ascending order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Followers table:
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | follower_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |
+---------+-------------+
Output:

plaintext
+---------+----------------+
| user_id | followers_count|
+---------+----------------+
| 0       | 1              |
| 1       | 1              |
| 2       | 2              |
+---------+----------------+
Explanation:

The followers of user 0 are {1}.

The followers of user 1 are {0}.

The followers of user 2 are {0,1}.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds the number of followers for each user:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the number of followers for each user
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM 
    Followers
GROUP BY 
    user_id
ORDER BY 
    user_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT user_id, COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count: This part of the query selects the user_id and counts the follower_id values for each user. The result is aliased as followers_count.

FROM Followers: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Followers table.

GROUP BY user_id: This groups the results by the user_id to calculate the number of followers for each user.

ORDER BY user_id: This orders the results by user_id in ascending order.

Comments:
This solution efficiently calculates the number of followers for each user and returns the result ordered by user_id in ascending order.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
