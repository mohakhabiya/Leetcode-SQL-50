LeetCode Problem: 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

Problem Description:

Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+

product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not. recyclable is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Task: Write a solution to find the IDs of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output:

plaintext
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

Solution:
The following SQL query selects the product_id from the Products table where both low_fats and recyclable are 'Y'.

sql
-- SQL Solution to find product IDs that are both low fat and recyclable

SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT product_id: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the product_id column from the table.

FROM Products: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Products table.

WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y': This condition filters the rows to include only those products where the low_fats column is 'Y' and the recyclable column is 'Y'.

Comments:
This solution efficiently filters and retrieves only the desired products that meet both conditions.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
