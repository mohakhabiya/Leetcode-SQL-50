LeetCode Problem: 1683. Invalid Tweets

Problem Description:
Table: Tweets

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| tweet_id       | int     |
| content        | varchar |
+----------------+---------+

tweet_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

content consists of characters on an American Keyboard, and no other special characters.

This table contains all the tweets in a social media app.

Definition of an Invalid Tweet:

A tweet is invalid if the number of characters used in the content of the tweet is strictly greater than 15.

Task: Write a solution to find the IDs of the invalid tweets.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Tweets table:
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| tweet_id | content                           |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
| 1        | Let us Code                       |
| 2        | More than fifteen chars are here! |
+----------+-----------------------------------+
Output:

plaintext
+----------+
| tweet_id |
+----------+
| 2        |
+----------+
Explanation:

Tweet 1 has a length of 11. It is a valid tweet.

Tweet 2 has a length of 33. It is an invalid tweet.

Solution:
The following SQL query selects the tweet_id from the Tweets table where the length of the content is strictly greater than 15.

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the IDs of invalid tweets
SELECT tweet_id
FROM Tweets
WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT tweet_id: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the tweet_id column from the table.

FROM Tweets: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Tweets table.

WHERE LENGTH(content) > 15: This condition filters the rows to include only those where the length of the content is strictly greater than 15.

Comments:
This solution efficiently filters and retrieves the tweet IDs of tweets that are considered invalid due to their content length.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
