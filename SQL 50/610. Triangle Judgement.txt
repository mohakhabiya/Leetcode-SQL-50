LeetCode Problem: 610. Triangle Judgement
Problem Description:
Table: Triangle

Column Name	Type
x	int
y	int
z	int
In SQL, (x, y, z) is the primary key column for this table.

Each row of this table contains the lengths of three line segments.

Task: Report for every three line segments whether they can form a triangle.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output:

plaintext
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+
Solution:
The following SQL query determines whether three line segments can form a triangle for every row in the Triangle table:

sql
-- SQL Solution to determine if three line segments can form a triangle
SELECT 
    x, 
    y, 
    z, 
    CASE 
        WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes'
        ELSE 'No'
    END AS triangle
FROM 
    Triangle;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT x, y, z, CASE WHEN x + y > z AND x + z > y AND y + z > x THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS triangle: This part of the query selects the x, y, z columns from the Triangle table and uses a CASE statement to determine if the three line segments can form a triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three line segments to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

FROM Triangle: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Triangle table.

Comments:
This solution efficiently checks the triangle inequality theorem for each row in the Triangle table and reports whether the segments can form a triangle.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
