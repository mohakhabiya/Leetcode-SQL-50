LeetCode Problem: 596. Classes More Than 5 Students
Problem Description:
Table: Courses

Column Name	Type
student	varchar
class	varchar
(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.

Task: Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output:

plaintext
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation:

Math has 6 students, so we include it.

English has 1 student, so we do not include it.

Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.

Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.

Solution:
The following SQL query finds all the classes that have at least five students:

sql
-- SQL Solution to find all the classes that have at least five students
SELECT class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY class
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT class: This part of the query selects the class column from the Courses table.

FROM Courses: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Courses table.

GROUP BY class: This groups the results by the class column.

HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5: This condition filters the groups to include only those classes that have at least five students.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and retrieves the desired classes with at least five students.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
