Solution:
The following SQL query selects the name and bonus of each employee with a bonus less than 1000. If an employee does not have a bonus, it shows null for the bonus.

sql
-- SQL Solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000
SELECT E.name, B.bonus
FROM Employee E
LEFT JOIN Bonus B ON E.empId = B.empId
WHERE B.bonus < 1000 OR B.bonus IS NULL;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT E.name, B.bonus: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the name from the Employee table (aliased as E) and the bonus from the Bonus table (aliased as B).

FROM Employee E: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Employee table, aliased as E.

LEFT JOIN Bonus B ON E.empId = B.empId: This performs a left join of the Employee table with the Bonus table on the empId column. A left join ensures that all employees are included in the result, even if they don't have a corresponding bonus.

WHERE B.bonus< 1000 OR B.bonusIS NULL: This condition filters the rows to include only those employees with a bonus less than 1000 or no bonus at all.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and retrieves the names and bonus amounts of employees with a bonus less than 1000 or no bonus at all.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.
