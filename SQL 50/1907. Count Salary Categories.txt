LeetCode Problem: 1907. Count Salary Categories
Problem Description:
Table: Accounts

Column Name	Type
account_id	int
income	        int
account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.

Task: Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

"Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.

"Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].

"High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

Return: The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0. The result table can be in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+
Output:

plaintext
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
Explanation:

Low Salary: Account 2.

Average Salary: No accounts.

High Salary: Accounts 3, 6, and 8.

Solution:
The following SQL query calculates the number of bank accounts for each salary category:

sql
-- SQL Solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income < 20000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000
UNION ALL
SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income > 50000;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category, COUNT() AS accounts_count FROM Accounts WHERE income < 20000:* This part of the query selects the category "Low Salary" and counts the number of accounts with income strictly less than $20000.

UNION ALL: This combines the results of the three SELECT queries to ensure that all categories are included.

SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category, COUNT() AS accounts_count FROM Accounts WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000:* This part of the query selects the category "Average Salary" and counts the number of accounts with income in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].

SELECT 'High Salary' AS category, COUNT() AS accounts_count FROM Accounts WHERE income > 50000:* This part of the query selects the category "High Salary" and counts the number of accounts with income strictly greater than $50000.

Comments:
This solution efficiently calculates the number of bank accounts for each salary category and ensures that all three categories are included, even if some have zero accounts.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
