Problem Description:
Table: Customer

| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |
+-------------+---------+

id is the primary key column for this table. Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.

Task: Write a solution to find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output:

plaintext
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
Explanation: Only customers Will, Jane, Bill, and Zack are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Solution:
The following SQL query selects the name from the Customer table where the referee_id is not 2 or is NULL.

sql
-- SQL Solution to find the names of customers not referred by the customer with id = 2

SELECT name
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL;

Explanation of the Code:

SELECT name: This part of the query specifies that we want to select the name column from the table.

FROM Customer: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Customer table.

WHERE referee_id != 2 OR referee_id IS NULL: This condition filters the rows to include only those customers where the referee_id is not 2 or is NULL.

Comments:
This solution efficiently filters and retrieves only the desired customers that are not referred by the customer with id = 2.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
