LeetCode Problem: 196. Delete Duplicate Emails
Problem Description:
Table: Person

Column Name	Type
id	int
email	varchar
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.

Task: Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.

Note for SQL users: You are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output:

plaintext
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation:

john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest id = 1.

Solution:
The following SQL query deletes all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id:

sql
-- SQL Solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id
DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
INNER JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id;
Explanation of the Code:

DELETE p1 FROM Person p1 INNER JOIN Person p2 ON p1.email= p2.emailAND p1.id> p2.id:

DELETE p1: This part of the query specifies that we want to delete rows from the table alias p1.

FROM Person p1 INNER JOIN Person p2: This joins the Person table with itself to compare rows.

ON p1.email= p2.emailAND p1.id> p2.id: This condition ensures that we compare rows with the same email and delete the row with the larger id. This way, only the row with the smallest id for each email is kept.
