/* LeetCode Problem: 1045. Customers Who Bought All Products
Problem Description:
Table: Customer

Column Name	Type
customer_id	int
product_key	int
This table may contain duplicate rows.

customer_id is not NULL.

product_key is a foreign key (reference column) to the Product table.

Table: Product

Column Name	Type
product_key	int
product_key is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

Task: Write a solution to report the customer IDs from the Customer table that bought all the products in the Product table.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Customer table:
+-------------+-------------+
| customer_id | product_key |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+

Product table:
+-------------+
| product_key |
+-------------+
| 5           |
| 6           |
+-------------+
Output:

plaintext
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation:

The customers who bought all the products (5 and 6) are customers with IDs 1 and 3.

Solution:
The following SQL query reports the customer IDs that bought all the products in the Product table:

sql
-- SQL Solution to report the customer IDs that bought all the products in the Product table */
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product);
/*  Explanation of the Code:

SELECT customer_id: This part of the query selects the customer_id from the Customer table.

FROM Customer: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Customer table.

GROUP BY customer_id: This groups the results by the customer_id.

HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (SELECT COUNT() FROM Product):* This condition filters the groups to include only those customers who bought all the distinct products. The inner query (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product) calculates the total number of distinct products in the Product table.

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and retrieves the customer IDs that bought all the products in the Product table.

Make sure the database and tables are correctly set up before running the query.   */
