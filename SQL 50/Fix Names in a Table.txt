LeetCode Problem: 1667. Fix Names in a Table
Problem Description:
Table: Users

Column Name	Type
user_id	int
name	varchar
user_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.

This table contains the ID and the name of the user. The name consists of only lowercase and uppercase characters.

Task: Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.

Return: The result table ordered by user_id.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Users table:
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | aLice |
| 2       | bOB   |
+---------+-------+
Output:

plaintext
+---------+-------+
| user_id | name  |
+---------+-------+
| 1       | Alice |
| 2       | Bob   |
+---------+-------+
Solution:
The following SQL query fixes the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase:

sql
-- SQL Solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name
FROM 
    Users
ORDER BY 
    user_id;
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1)), LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2))) AS name:

This part of the query selects the user_id and applies string functions to fix the name.

UPPER(SUBSTRING(name, 1, 1)): Extracts the first character of the name and converts it to uppercase.

LOWER(SUBSTRING(name, 2)): Extracts the rest of the name starting from the second character and converts it to lowercase.

CONCAT(...): Concatenates the uppercase first character and the lowercase rest of the name.

FROM Users: This indicates that the data should be selected from the Users table.

ORDER BY user_id: This orders the result by user_id in ascending order.

Comments:
This solution efficiently fixes the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase, and returns the result table ordered by user_id.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
