LeetCode Problem: 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee
Problem Description:
Table: Employee

Column Name	Type
employee_id	int
department_id	int
primary_flag	varchar
(employee_id, department_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.

employee_id is the ID of the employee.

department_id is the ID of the department to which the employee belongs.

primary_flag is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N'). If the flag is 'Y', the department is the primary department for the employee. If the flag is 'N', the department is not the primary.

Task: Write a solution to report all the employees with their primary department. For employees who belong to one department, report their only department.

Return: The result table in any order.

Example:
Input:

plaintext
Employee table:
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| employee_id | department_id | primary_flag |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
| 1           | 1             | N            |
| 2           | 1             | Y            |
| 2           | 2             | N            |
| 3           | 3             | N            |
| 4           | 2             | N            |
| 4           | 3             | Y            |
| 4           | 4             | N            |
+-------------+---------------+--------------+
Output:

plaintext
+-------------+---------------+
| employee_id | department_id |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 1             |
| 3           | 3             |
| 4           | 3             |
+-------------+---------------+
Explanation:

The primary department for employee 1 is 1.

The primary department for employee 2 is 1.

The primary department for employee 3 is 3.

The primary department for employee 4 is 3.

Solution:
The following SQL query reports the primary department for each employee:

sql
-- SQL Solution to report all the employees with their primary department
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y'
   OR (employee_id, primary_flag) IN (SELECT employee_id, 'N' FROM Employee
                                      GROUP BY employee_id
                                      HAVING COUNT(*) = 1);
Explanation of the Code:

SELECT employee_id, department_id: This part of the query selects the employee_id and department_id from the Employee table.

WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR (employee_id, primary_flag) IN (SELECT employee_id, 'N' FROM Employee GROUP BY employee_id HAVING COUNT() = 1):* This condition filters the results to include only those employees where:

The primary_flag is 'Y' (i.e., the department is marked as the primary department), or

The employee belongs to only one department (i.e., the primary_flag is 'N' and the employee appears only once in the table).

Comments:
This solution efficiently identifies and retrieves the primary department for each employee.

Make sure the database and table are correctly set up before running the query.
